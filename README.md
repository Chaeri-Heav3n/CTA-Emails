# Call To Action Emails

Every email should be created with a goal in mind. A call to action is the element that is added to an email (usually a button) that allows subscribers to take a specific action. 

Ideally, there should be one kind of action per email. Otherwise, you run the risk of confusing the customer or making the email too complicated. A subscriber should be able to take a quick glance at the email and immediately understand what it is for.
